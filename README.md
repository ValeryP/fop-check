Every year the Ukrainian government selects thousands of private companies to inspect their 
documents and business activity. They are unexpected for the business and could lead to high fines. 
The website allows the business owners to check the date and the topic of the inspection to prepare 
for the inspection in advance and proceed smoothly.
